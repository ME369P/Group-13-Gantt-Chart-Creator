Project: Python Gantt Chart Application

Objective: Create a gantt chart application that is able to read data from a csv file, plot gantt chart, and allow user to update gantt
chart in real time.

Notes:
Chart x axis represents days of the month
Program still requires updates for robustness. It will crash if you input incorrect data into the entry input boxes:
A task name is required.
A task cost can be a float/int or N/A.
A task contributer can be a name or N/A.
The task start date should be the day of the month that the project will be started
The task duration is how many days the project will take to complete
A color is required for the chart
